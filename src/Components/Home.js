          <h2>Hi I'm <strong>Megan Huckabay</strong> but you can call me <strong>MEG</strong></h2>

        <p>Greetings! <strong>I'm a 33-year-old California native</strong>, proud to call the Golden State my home. Those who know me best often describe me as the <strong>"most kind-hearted and loving person" </strong>who consistently seeks the silver lining even in the toughest of situations.<br />

        Having witnessed the challenges of the homeless crisis in California, I firmly believe in the transformative power of <strong>KINDNESS and HOPE</strong>. These are not just words but guiding principles that I carry with me in all aspects of life.<br />

        On a professional note, I recently graduated from<strong> BloomTech Institute of Technology as a Full-Stack Web Developer</strong>. Now, I invite you to explore the pages of my digital home, where you can learn more about my journey and the projects that define my passion for technology.<br />

        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy navigating through the various facets of my story.</p>
